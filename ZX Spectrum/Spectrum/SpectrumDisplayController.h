 Middleware between underlying display C API and higher level Objective-C and especially Swift APIs.
 
 The main reasoning behind this class is to simplify Swift implementation which can be quite messy with unsafe pointer calls. Objective-C can access C APIs without any complications on the other hand.
 
 Note: there can only be single handler at the time for simplicity and performance reasons.
